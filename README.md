# Multithreading with Node.js

This project demonstrates how to use multithreading in Node.js by using worker threads. The project contains two folders: `singlethread` and `multithread`.

## Singlethread

The `singlethread` folder contains an `index.js` file that demonstrates how to run the Fibonacci function in a single thread. To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run singlethread
```
## Multithread

The `multithread` folder contains an `index.js` file that demonstrates how to run the Fibonacci function using worker threads. To run the script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run multithread
```
